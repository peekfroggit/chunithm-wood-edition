A chunithm cabinet frame made out of wood and metal brackets.

The main reference and inspiration was from Cetaceaqua's CHUNIFRAME.

This is basically a CHUNIFRAME but made out of a wood and a few modifications.

#Disclaimer
This project is for people that do not have limited to no experience with using cad software, but have a decent amount of experience woodworking.

This is also for people that are on a tight budget and cannot afford to buy aluminum bars or custom acrylic.

Material buying is for people that want to buy materials through amazon or their local hardware store without the hassle of buying from sites
that they are not comfortable with.

# Materials
* 2x2 Wood

* 1in angle brackets

* 2in mending plates

* tv vesa wall mount

* toggle latch clamps

* 2in caster wheels

# Notes
The 2x2 Wood I used was a 42in long pressure treated lumber I got on home depot. Don't cheap out on getting the furring strip wood, they have horrible qa (quality assurance).
Keep in mind the 2x2 wood actually measures around 1.75in, so do keep in mind when you are cutting and mending (probably overcut than cut exact just in case).

I used a jigsaw as my cutting tool for the entire project, so my cuts are inaccurate (as some of the wood cuts were shorter than usual, as such I reccomend something like a
chopsaw, bandsaw, or a laser cutter for accurate cuts, otherwise a jigsaw was fine if you have steady hands.
