# chunithm_wood-edition
A chunithm cabinet frame made out of wood and metal brackets.

The main reference and inspiration was from Cetaceaqua's CHUNIFRAME.

This is basically a CHUNIFRAME but made out of a wood and a few modifications.

# Disclaimer
This project is for people that do not have limited to no experience with using cad software, but have a decent amount of experience woodworking.

This is also for people that are on a tight budget and cannot afford to buy aluminum bars or custom acrylic.

Material buying is for people that want to buy materials through amazon or their local hardware store without the hassle of buying from sites
that they are not comfortable with.

# Tools
* Drill
* Jigsaw
* Vice Clamps (to hold down wood for cutting)
* Pencil (for measurements)
* Metric ruler/measure tape (for referencing CHUNIFRAME's aluminum profile dimensions)

# Materials
* 2x2 Wood
* Plywood
* 1in 90 degree angle brackets
* 1in 45 degree angle brackets
* 2in mending plates
* tv vesa wall mount
* toggle latch clamps
* 2in caster wheels
* 32in monitor (at least 120hz)

# Notes
The 2x2 Wood I used was a 42in long pressure treated lumber I got on home depot. Don't cheap out on getting the furring strip wood, they have horrible qa (quality assurance).
Keep in mind the 2x2 wood actually measures around 1.75in, so do keep in mind when you are cutting and mending (probably overcut than cut exact just in case).

I used the air attachment from mon's chuni ac case for attaching the airs to the chuni frame, ideally it would be a custom cut acrylic for the airs but I'm too lazy and broke lol.

I made the frame a two piece design so that I can easily transport the cab to different locations. You can follow the original aluminum profiles to make a one piece version instead.

I didn't ask the original creator of the CHUNIFRAME for help, which kind of shows with the monitor mount.

I used a jigsaw as my cutting tool for the entire project, so my cuts are inaccurate (as some of the wood cuts were shorter than usual, as such I reccomend something like a
chopsaw, bandsaw, or a laser cutter for accurate cuts, otherwise a jigsaw was fine if you have steady hands.

I don't really care if you sell it to other people, just because there's people that don't have handywork skills and rather
pay money to make them for you.
